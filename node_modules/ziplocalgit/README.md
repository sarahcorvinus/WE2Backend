**Zip local git repository, used for student submissions**

This small library provides a command line tool in order to zip the local git repository.
It is used in the context of a university class in which students have to submit their solutions by means of a zip file containing the local git repository. The idea behind that is, that instead of simply creating a zip of the solution, git is to be used and, more importantly, the lecturer gets all the git logs in order to improve check of copies. Error messages are emitted in German language at the moment.

## Install

Install with npm:

```
npm install --save-dev ziplocalgit
```

## Usage

Usage: `ziplocalgit zip [options]`

Create a zip file with local git (.git)

Options:
- `--noCommitCheck`           Do not check that - all files are committed (default: false)
-  ` --noOverwrite`             Do not overwrite - existing submission zip (default: false)
-   `-f --filename <filename>`  Name of zip file, - use ${CWD} for (simple) name of current - folder. (default: "abgabe_${CWD}.zip")
-   `--minsize <minsize>`       Emit warning if - zip file size is less than min size (in - kByte). (default: "20")
-   `--maxsize <maxsize>`       Emit warning if - zip file size is greater than min size (in - kByte). (default: "2000")
-   `-h, --help`                display help for command

Usually you want to create a script in `package.json`, e.g.

```
"scripts": {
    "abgabe": "npx ziplocalgit -f abgabe_Blatt_0"
}
```
